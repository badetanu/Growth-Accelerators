Disposable film cameras are popular for capturing spontaneous moments during vacations, parties, and other social gatherings. Their compact size and lightweight nature make them ideal for on-the-go use, and they offer a straightforward solution for users who wish to document their experiences without the hassle of digital technology. Additionally, the trend of using disposable cameras for events like weddings and festivals contributes significantly to their market share.
